Algorithmic Fairness in Public Civic Datasets (API-based)
Overview

This project demonstrates the collection, preprocessing, and analysis of public civic datasets via API endpoints, with a focus on evaluating algorithmic fairness. It leverages real-time civic service data from Chicago 311 and NYC 311, providing reproducible pipelines to measure bias across demographic or service-related groups.

The project highlights technical research engineering skills in Python, API integration, reproducible workflows, and fairness evaluation—key for socially aligned AI systems.

Features

API-based Data Retrieval: Fetches live civic datasets from:

Chicago 311: https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/v3/views/ijzp-q8t2/query.json

NYC 311: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/v3/views/erm2-nwe9/query.json

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.

Fairness Evaluation: Computes demographic parity differences and other fairness metrics.

Experiment Tracking: Optional MLflow integration for reproducible and versioned experiments.

Extensible Pipeline: Designed for integration with civic AI agents or NLP analysis frameworks.

Installation
git clone <repo-url>
cd civic-fairness-api
pip install -r requirements.txt


Requirements:

Python 3.9+

pandas

scikit-learn

mlflow

requests

Usage
python src/analyze.py


This runs the full pipeline: fetches Chicago & NYC civic datasets via API, preprocesses the data, computes fairness metrics, and logs results with MLflow.
